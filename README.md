# BINARY-AND-TERNARY-COMPLEXES-OF-CLOPIDOGREL-BISULPHATE-AND-DOLUTEGRAVIR-SODIUM
Extensive research work supports the understanding that cyclodextrins have the capacity
to form molecular inclusion complexes and through the process of complex formation can
alter the physico-chemical properties of the complexed drug molecules. The basic advantage
in this process is that complexation with cyclodextrins alters the physico-chemical properties
of the drug candidate without altering its pharmacological properties. It is now well
established that complexation with cyclodextrins can alter properties of the drug such as
solubility, dissolution rate, stability, palatability, and bioavailability. All these properties of
the drug candidate are favourably affected. These complexing agents also have approvals
from the regulatory agencies. Because of all these favourable qualities, cyclodextrins are
being widely used in pharmaceutical formulation development.
Clopidogrel bisulphate is an antiplatelet drug. Its aqueous solubility is very low
(0.0118Âµg/mL). It is known to have high permeability and is classified as a BCS class-II drug
its molecular weight is 321.822 g/mol. Hence, it may be considered as a suitable drug
candidate for inclusion complex formation. Cyclodextrin complexation was thus taken up
with the objective of enhancing the aqueous solubility, dissolution rate and bioavailability of
clopidogrel bisulphate.
Dolutegravir sodium is an anti-retroviral drug. Its aqueous solubility is very low
(0.0922mg/mL). It has high permeability and is classified as BCS Class-II drug. Its molecular
weight is 441.367 g/mol. This drug can also be considered as a suitable candidate for the
formation of inclusion complexes, with the objective of enhancing its solubility, dissolution
rate and bioavailability.
